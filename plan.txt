#Above works well.
#Need to sort the AWK / sed command now to format thie weball20.txt
#Plan -
# 1) AWK to format the text doc.
# 2) enter the state & district which passes into two variables state = NY & district = district no. DONE
# 3) Parse these ST & DI to the sed command to extract the desired state and district. DONE
# 4) This will create text file. Containing Candidate name, party, $ received & $ spent. DONE
# 5) Use AWK again to pretty up this text file. DONE

Now want to loop through each congressional seat and pick the top row. Which is the highest spent.
Then collate or concatenate these into one master file. Count the parties. We have a winner



Maybe an option to do this for all ? Need to find a way to only show Candidate on ballots.



CLEAN UP
state INPUT CHECKER. loop back if bad entry. Somehow need to enter correct number of districts.
