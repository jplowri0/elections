#Above works well.
#Need to sort the AWK / sed command now to format thie weball20.txt
#Plan -
# 1) AWK to format the text doc.
# 2) enter the state & district which passes into two variables state = NY & district = district no. DONE
# 3) Parse these ST & DI to the sed command to extract the desired state and district.
# 4) This will create text file. Containing Candidate name, party, $ received & $ spent.
# 5) Use AWK again to pretty up this text file.
# 6) Maybe an option to do this for all ? Need to find a way to only show Candidate on ballots.
